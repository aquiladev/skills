# OpenClaw Memory Management Skill

You are helping a user manage, diagnose, and optimize memory in their OpenClaw agent. OpenClaw's memory system is file-based — if information isn't written to disk, it doesn't survive compaction or new sessions. Your job is to help users understand this, configure it properly, and build habits that prevent context loss.

## Core Principle

**If it's not written to a file, it doesn't exist.** Chat instructions do not survive long sessions. When compaction fires, anything only in conversation history gets summarized and the original wording is lost. Durable information must live in workspace files.

## The Four Memory Layers

When diagnosing memory issues, identify which layer failed:

1. **Bootstrap files** (`SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `TOOLS.md`) — loaded from disk at session start, survive compaction because they're reloaded from disk each turn. Most durable layer.
2. **Session transcript** — conversation saved on disk, but gets compacted (summarized) when context fills. The model loses access to original messages after compaction.
3. **LLM context window** — the ~200K token container where system prompt, workspace files, conversation history, and tool results all compete for space. When full, compaction fires.
4. **Retrieval index** — searchable layer beside memory files, queried via `memory_search` / `memory_get`. Only works if information was written to files first.

## Three Failure Modes

When diagnosing why an agent forgot something, check these in order:

- **Failure A (Never Stored):** The information only existed in chat, never written to a file. Most common cause. Fix: write it to `MEMORY.md` or a daily log.
- **Failure B (Compaction Loss):** Long session hit the token limit, compaction summary dropped important details. Fix: tune the pre-compaction flush config and use manual saves.
- **Failure C (Pruning Trimmed Tool Results):** Tool outputs (file reads, API responses) were trimmed by session pruning. Fix: save important tool results to files explicitly.

**Quick diagnostic:**
- Agent forgot a preference → Failure A (never in `MEMORY.md`)
- Agent forgot a whole conversation thread → Failure B (compaction/reset)
- Agent forgot what a tool returned → Failure C (pruning)

## Compaction vs. Pruning

These are different systems — help users understand the distinction:

- **Compaction** summarizes the entire conversation when the context window fills. It changes what the model sees. This is dangerous and causes most memory problems.
- **Pruning** trims old tool results in-memory. The on-disk session is untouched. Only affects tool result messages. User and assistant messages are never modified. Pruning is beneficial — it reduces bloat without destroying conversation context.

## Two Compaction Paths

- **Good path (maintenance):** Context nears limit → flush fires → agent saves important context to disk → compaction summarizes → agent continues. This is what configuration optimizes for.
- **Bad path (overflow recovery):** Context gets too big, API rejects → no flush happens → OpenClaw compresses everything in damage control → maximum context loss.

The goal of all configuration is to stay on the good path.

## Configuration

When helping users configure memory, use these recommended settings for `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (JSON5 format):

### Pre-Compaction Flush (Most Important Config)

```json5
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "compaction": {
        // Headroom: space for flush turn + compaction summary
        // Flush triggers at: context_window - reserveTokensFloor - softThresholdTokens
        // With 200K window: 200,000 - 40,000 - 4,000 = 156K tokens
        "reserveTokensFloor": 40000,
        "memoryFlush": {
          "enabled": true,        // Verify this is on!
          "softThresholdTokens": 4000  // How far before floor flush triggers
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Tuning guidance:**
- `reserveTokensFloor: 40000` is a practical starting point. If the user rarely uses big tools, it can go lower. If they read large files or web snapshots regularly, go higher.
- The exact number matters less than the principle: give the flush enough room to fire before overflow.
- The automated flush is a safety net, not a guarantee.

### Track A: Built-in Memory Search (Recommend for most users)

```json5
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "memory": {
        "search": {
          "enabled": true,
          "hybrid": true,
          "embeddingModel": "local"
        }
      },
      "cacheTTL": 300
    }
  }
}
```

- No extra installs needed. Indexes `MEMORY.md` and `memory/` directory automatically.
- Hybrid search combines keyword matching with semantic embeddings.
- Local embedding model downloads automatically on first use.
- **Track A+ variant:** add extra paths to index Markdown files outside the workspace.

### Track B: QMD Backend (Advanced, for thousands of files)

Same compaction/pruning config plus:

```json5
{
  "memory": {
    "backend": "qmd",
    "qmd": {
      "paths": ["/path/to/obsidian/vault", "/path/to/docs"],
      "indexSessions": true
    }
  }
}
```

- QMD = Query Markdown Documents. Replaces built-in indexer.
- For large vaults (thousands of files), past session transcripts, multiple collections.
- Returns small snippets instead of whole files (helps with context size).
- DM-only by default — doesn't work in group chats unless scope is changed.

Recommend Track A for users starting out, graduate to Track B when they need to search large knowledge bases.

## Workspace File Architecture

Guide users to organize their bootstrap files correctly:

| File | Purpose | What Goes Here |
|---|---|---|
| `SOUL.md` | Agent identity (character) | Tone, personality, broad boundaries |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent operations (process) | Workflow rules, tool conventions, do/don't rules, the memory protocol |
| `USER.md` | User identity | Projects, clients, priorities, communication prefs, key people, tech environment |
| `MEMORY.md` | Cross-session truth (cheat sheet) | Important decisions + why, learned preferences, rules from past mistakes |
| `TOOLS.md` | Tool instructions | How to use specific tools, API conventions |
| `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Daily working context | Today's decisions, active tasks, status updates, flush output |

**Key rules:**
- `MEMORY.md` should stay under 100 lines — it's a cheat sheet, not a journal.
- It's always loaded, always in context, expensive in tokens and attention.
- Never store API keys, tokens, or secrets in memory files.
- Negative instructions (what NOT to do) are often the most valuable additions.
- Character → `SOUL.md`. Process → `AGENTS.md`.
- Sub-agents only get `AGENTS.md` — other bootstrap files are filtered out.

## The Memory Protocol

Always recommend adding this to `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Memory Protocol
Before doing anything non-trivial, search memory first.
- Use `memory_search` to find relevant context from past sessions
- Use `memory_get` to read specific memory files
- Check notes before acting — don't guess from context alone
```

Without this, the agent answers from whatever is in context. With it, the agent looks things up first.

## Bootstrap File Limits

- Per-file limit: 20,000 characters (default)
- Combined limit: 150,000 characters across all bootstrap files
- Character counts, not tokens (~150K chars ≈ 37-38K tokens)
- Files exceeding the limit are truncated: 70% head, 20% tail, 10% truncation marker
- If a file is not in context, it has zero effect on the agent

## Diagnostics Checklist

When a user reports memory issues, walk them through this:

1. **Run `/context list`** — the fastest way to diagnose memory problems.
   - Is `MEMORY.md` loading? If missing or not listed, it's not in context.
   - Are any files truncated? Check if raw chars = injected chars.
   - If files are truncated, the invisible portion has zero effect on the agent.

2. **Run `/status`** — verify model, context window, and thinking level.

3. **Check the config** — is `memoryFlush.enabled` true? Is `reserveTokensFloor` high enough?

4. **Review what's in `MEMORY.md`** — is the important information actually there?

5. **Test retrieval** — run `/verbose` and have the agent search for something specific. Does it find it?

## Manual Memory Habits

Recommend these habits to users:

- **Save manually** after important decisions, before switching tasks, before complex instructions.
- **Use `/compact` proactively** mid-session with optional focus: `/compact and focus on decisions and open questions`.
- **Use `/new`** when switching between unrelated tasks for a clean context.
- **Don't wait until near overflow** — at that point, even `/compact` can fail.

## Memory Hygiene Over Time

- **Daily:** Append to daily log (automatic via flush).
- **Weekly:** Promote durable rules and important decisions from daily logs into `MEMORY.md`. Remove stale or outdated entries. Can be automated via weekly cron job.
- **Git backup:** `git init` in workspace, auto-commit daily. Never commit credentials folder or `openclaw.json`.

## Cost Awareness

Compaction invalidates the prompt cache. The next request after compaction pays full price to re-cache everything. Unnecessary compaction is both a reliability and cost problem.

Two things break the cache:
1. Compaction (rewrites history)
2. Frequently changing prompt inputs (constantly rewriting `MEMORY.md`, dynamic status blocks)

Keep workspace files stable and `MEMORY.md` small for maximum cache efficiency.

## Essential Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/context list` | Check what's loaded, spot truncation |
| `/compact [focus]` | Manual compaction with optional focus guidance |
| `/status` | Verify model, context window, thinking level |
| `/new` | Fresh session with clean context |
| `/verbose` | Debug memory search results |

## What to Remember

Whenever wrapping up a memory-related conversation, reinforce these five principles:

1. **Files are memory.** Not on disk = doesn't exist.
2. **Verify and tune the flush.** `reserveTokensFloor: 40000`.
3. **Compact proactively.** `/compact` mid-session, on your terms.
4. **Search before acting.** Put this rule in `AGENTS.md`.
5. **Pruning is your friend.** Compaction is what hurts.
